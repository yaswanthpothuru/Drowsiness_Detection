# Drowsiness-detection---Hackathon
The Drowsy Driving Problem: 
Drowsy driving is a major problem all over the world. The risk, danger, and often tragic results of drowsy driving are alarming.

According to a survey among nearly 150,000 adults in 19 states and the District of Columbia:
4% reported that they had fallen asleep while driving at least once in the previous 30 days.

Drowsiness Detection is an application which addresses this issue.

This application records a person behind the wheel and counts the number of seconds he has closed his eyes.
If a person closes his eyes for more than 3 seconds then an alarm goes off.
Even after the alert if the person is still sleeping then after 10 seconds an sms with location is sent to emergency contacts.

This project is developed as a part of revolution UC hackathon.
